# AirBnB_clone
ALX AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
This is the very first of four different phases in an attempt to replicate the AirBnB web-based application. In this first part of the project, an elementary console was set up using the Cmd Python module to control all of the project's objects. This facilitated the implementation of the create, show, update, all, and destroy methods to the classes and subclasses which were already in effect.

## Environment
This console is developed using Ubuntu 23.10 using version 3.12.3 of Python 3.

## Usage of the Console

### How to Install the Console
To install the console, simply run the command:

[$ git clone](https://github.com/MutaiT/AirBnB_clone.git)
